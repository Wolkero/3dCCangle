# Application of 3d human mesh recovery for the clinical documentation of Camptocormia

This is the accompanying respository for the paper "Application of 3d human mesh recovery for the clinical documentation of Camptocormia" by Wolke et al. The original pictures used to evaluate the approach for the estimation of the cmaptocormia bending angle as described in ([link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29907329/)) are not available due to data protection policy.

# How to apply

1. Clone the respository ([link](https://github.com/mkocabas/PARE)) and follow the instructions to run the algorithm.

2. Read the instructions

```
python 

```
3. To view the output in blender (link blender) use the tofbx.py conversion (adapted from VIBE ([link](https://github.com/mkocabas/VIBE/blob/master/lib/utils/fbx_output.py)) and slightly modified.
```
python 

```
